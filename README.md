---

**English description**

A schema.org/LRMI-based profile for describing learning resource metadata following NS 4180:2020 developed and published as JSON Schema, and based on a LRMI-profile from a German project: https://dini-ag-kim.github.io/lrmi-profile/draft/schemas/schema.json. The intention is to test this schema with an editor created by the same project, [SkoHub Editor](https://skohub.io/editor/). The profile might be published as a HTML spec in the future.
